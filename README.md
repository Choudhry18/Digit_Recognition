Digit Classification

This project implements a naive Bayesian classifier for a set of scanned handwritten digit images. The task is to guess which digit a handwritten image is supposed to be. T. The goal of a classifier is to compute the most likely digit for an unclassified image, by breaking the image apart into features and ranking each digit by how closely it matches the image.
